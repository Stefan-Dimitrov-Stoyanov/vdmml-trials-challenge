Champion model based on misclassification rate was a Gradient Boosting model with Variable Clustering
KS: 0.5797
Misclassification Rate: 0.1275

Love the variable clustering node. It grouped my variables according to the clusters before it performed the modelling. I did change the
subsample rate to 1 for both the gradient boosting model without variable clustering and the one with clustering so that I didn't have any
of the variation that can happen with subsampling.
